# AOSP+OP-TEE manifest

This repository contains a local manifest that can be used to build an
AOSP build that includes OP-TEE for the hikey board.

## 1. References

* [AOSP Hikey build instructions][1]

## 2. Prerequisites

* Should already be able to build AOSP.  Distro should have necessary
  packages installed, and the repo tool should be installed.  Note
  that AOSP needs to be built with Java.  Also make sure that
  the `mtools` package is installed, which is needed to make the hikey
  boot image.

* In addition, you will need the pre-requisites necessary to build
  optee-os.

  After following the AOSP setup instructions, the following
  additional packages are needed.

```bash
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot autoconf \
	automake bc bison build-essential cscope curl device-tree-compiler flex \
	ftp-upload gdisk iasl libattr1-dev libc6:i386 libcap-dev libfdt-dev \
	libftdi-dev libglib2.0-dev libhidapi-dev libncurses5-dev \
	libpixman-1-dev libssl-dev libstdc++6:i386 libtool libz1:i386 make \
	mtools netcat python-crypto python-serial python-wand unzip uuid-dev \
	xdg-utils xterm xz-utils zlib1g-dev \
	ncurses-dev realpath android-tools-fsutils dosfstools libxml2-utils
```

## 3. Build steps

### 3.1. In an empty directory, clone the tree:

```bash
repo init -u https://android-git.linaro.org/git/platform/manifest.git -b android-7.1.2_r33 -g "default,-non-default,-device,hikey,fugu"

# Please do NOT run below command! Internal reference only!
# repo init -u /home/ubuntu/aosp-mirror/platform/manifest.git -b android-7.1.2_r33 -g "default,-non-default,-device,hikey,fugu" -p linux --depth=1
```

**WARNING**: To avoid errors, it's recommended NOT to use `--depth=1` option,
unless you know what you're doing!

### 3.2. Add the OP-TEE overlay:

```bash
cd .repo
git clone https://android-git.linaro.org/git/platform/manifest.git -b linaro-nougat-tv local_manifests
cd local_manifests
rm -f optee.xml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linaro-swg/optee_android_manifest/hikey-n-4.9-master/optee.xml
cd ../../
```

### 3.3. Sync

```bash
repo sync
repo manifest -r -o pinned-manifest.xml
```

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** use -c option!

### 3.4. Apply the required patches (**please respect order!**)

**NOTE:** Apply the patches below **1 by 1** and make sure each patch is
applied successfully before applying the next one!

``` bash
./android-patchsets/hikey-n-workarounds
./android-patchsets/get-hikey-blobs
./android-patchsets/NOUGAT-RLCR-PATCHSET
./android-patchsets/hikey-optee-n
./android-patchsets/hikey-optee-4.9
./android-patchsets/optee-master-workarounds
./android-patchsets/swg-mods-n
```

**WARNING: If you run `repo sync` again at any time in the future to update
all the repos, by default all the patches above would be discarded, so you'll
have reapply them again before rebuilding!**

### 3.5. Configure the environment for AOSP

```bash
source ./build/envsetup.sh
lunch hikey-userdebug
```
**WARNING**: Do **NOT** use `sudo`!

### 3.6. Build the booloader firmware (fip.bin) [OPTIONAL]

Previously, it was required to build `fip.bin` separately, but
it has now been included as part of this AOSP build, so this
step is **NO** longer required!

**NOTE**: IF you just want to build `fip.bin` without rebuilding
the rest of AOSP:
```bash
pushd device/linaro/hikey/bootloader
make TARGET_TEE_IS_OPTEE=true #make sure build is successful
popd
cp out/dist/fip.bin device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/
cp out/dist/l-loader.bin device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/
```

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** use `sudo`!

If you get errors while `fip.bin` is building, or
if `fip.bin` is NOT working as expected,
try deleting the old build artifacts below and rebuild as above:
```
rm -f device/linaro/bootloader/edk2/Build/HiKey/RELEASE_GCC49/FV/fip.bin
rm -f out/dist/l-loader.bin
rm -f out/dist/fip.bin
rm -f optee/optee_os/out
rm -f out/target/product/hikey/optee/arm-plat-hikey
```

### 3.7. Run the rest of the AOSP build, For an 8GB board, use:

To enable adb over usb, in `device/linaro/hikey/init.common.usb.rc`:
```bash
setprop sys.usb.configfs 1
```

To build AOSP:
```bash
make TARGET_BUILD_KERNEL=true TARGET_BOOTIMAGE_USE_FAT=true \
TARGET_TEE_IS_OPTEE=true TARGET_BUILD_UEFI=true CFG_SECURE_DATA_PATH=y \
CFG_SECSTOR_TA_MGMT_PTA=y
```

For a 4GB board, use:
```bash
make TARGET_BUILD_KERNEL=true TARGET_BOOTIMAGE_USE_FAT=true \
TARGET_TEE_IS_OPTEE=true TARGET_BUILD_UEFI=true CFG_SECURE_DATA_PATH=y \
CFG_SECSTOR_TA_MGMT_PTA=y TARGET_USERDATAIMAGE_4GB=true
```

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** use `sudo`!

**WARNING: If you run `repo sync` again at any time in the future to update
all the repos, by default all the patches from 3.4 above would be discarded,
so you'll have reapply them again before rebuilding!**

## 4. Flashing the image

The instructions for flashing the image can be found in detail under
`device/linaro/hikey/install/README` in the tree.
1. Jumper links 1-2 and 3-4, leaving 5-6 open, and reset the board.
2. Invoke

```bash
cp -a out/target/product/hikey/*.img device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/
./device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/flash-all.sh /dev/ttyUSBn
sudo fastboot format userdata
```

where the ttyUSBn device is the one that appears after rebooting with
the 3-4 jumper installed.  Note that the device only remains in this
recovery mode for about 90 seconds.  If you take too long to run the
flash commands, it will need to be reset again.

## 5. Partial flashing

The last handful of lines in the `flash-all.sh` script flash various
images.  After modifying and rebuilding Android, it is only necessary
to flash *boot*, *system*, *cache*, and *userdata*.  If you aren't
modifying the kernel, *boot* is not necessary, either.

This directory contains a prebuilt trusted firmware image `fip.bin`.
If you wish to build the trusted os from source, follow the steps in the
**Build the bootloader firmware (fip.bin)** section above.

## 6. Running xtest

Please do NOT try to run `tee-supplicant` as it has already been started
automatically as a service! Once booted to the command prompt, `xtest`
can be run immediately.

## 7. Enable adb over usb

Boot the device. On serial console:

```bash
su setprop sys.usb.configfs 1
stop adbd
start adbd
```
